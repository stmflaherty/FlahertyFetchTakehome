# FlahertyFetchTakehome

This repository contains 3 other files. First, the SQL file FlahertyFetchSQL, this is where I outlined each prompt and responded using comments before each block of SQL code. This file also contains commented responses to the written prompts.
Second, the python file, FlahertyFetchPyGraphs, contains the Python code that I used for visualization purposes. This code contains comments denoting the code for graphs A, B, and C, and those identifiers are used in the other files
to indicate code / output for the matching graphs. Lastly, the pdf file FlahertyFetchAppendix contains the visual outputs from the python code.
